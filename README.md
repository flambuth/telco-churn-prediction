README Classification Project
The Classification project is looking at the Telco Churn dataset. We will be attempting to answer several questions surrounding the likelihood of customer churn based on several factors including type of internet service and tenure.

Prerequisites
The code was written in Python 3.7.3 and you will need to have pandas, numpy, matplotlib,seaborn, and sklearn installed. 

Additionally, you will need access to the Telco dataset at:	157.230.209.171 
	-An env.py will be required with your user credentials for accessing the database at that IP address.


Installation
You will need the following Python files from the repository to run the project: 
acquire.py 
prepare.py 
model.py 
mvp.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)

Running the model
Notebook:
The mvp.ipynb should be executed  cell by cell to show the data analysis process.

Script:
The product.py is a script that will pull the information from the database and calculate the predicted classes and probabilities of those predictions.
